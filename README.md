=========================================

# Getting started

To setup the development environment...

1. Install Rust

```bash
# Install Rust toolchain
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Restart terminal and verify installation
cargo --version
rustc --version

# You should see output similar to:
cargo 1.90.0 (Homebrew)

# and:
rustc 1.90.0 (1159e78c4 2025-09-14) (Homebrew)
```

And configure the `rust-analyzer` extension in your IDE.
